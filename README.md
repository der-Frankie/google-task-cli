# gTask-cli

## Description

[gTask-cli](https://github.com/yankuangshi/gTask-cli) is a simple python CLI tool to manage your Google Tasks. It uses the [Google APIs Client Library for Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/) to interact with the [Google Tasks API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/).

## Requirements

Requires Python 2.7 to run the script. It also needs the following dependencies:

* [Google APIs Client Library for Python](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/)
* [argparse library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)
* [colorama library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama)

## Installation

All of dependencies above can be installed with `pip`:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Before using the script, there are a few steps you need to follow to register your app as it needs to be authorized to make requests to google service.

*  Go to [Google APIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to create a new project.

*  Click `APIs` in the project pane and activate the `Google Tasks API` for your project. 

*  Click `Credentials` in the project pane, in `OAuth` section create a new client ID, choose `Installed application` as `APPLICATION TYPE`. It will generate a `client ID` and a `client secret` which will be used for our tool.

*  In `Public API access` section, create a new key. Choose `Server key` from the pop-up. This will generate an `API key` which will be used in our script.

Now you've finished registering your project.

* [Download](https://github.com/yankuangshi/gTask-cli/archive/master.zip) zip and unzip the project or use git clone to download it 

* Add the generated `client ID`, `client secret` and `API key` to the `credentials.json` file

* For running the script anywhere from the command line and without the python command :

  * Make the gtask.py file executable `$ chmod +x gtask.py`
  
  * Add the gTask-cli project directory to your `PATH` environment variable. In your `.bashrc` file, add `export PATH=/path/to/project/:$PATH` and then `source` your `.bashrc` file
  
  * To simplify your use of the script, I recommend to add an alias to the gtask.py file, like : `alias gtask='/path/to/project/gtask.py'`
   
**NOTE:** For the first time, There will be a dialogue to request you for the permission to access your google tasks data, just copy the generated url and paste it in a browser address bar and accept the access to your tasks data, then paste the provided key back into the terminal. The `tasks.dat` file will be generated.

**NOTE:** Remember that you should never commit the credentials.json and tasks.dat files to your github.
